<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intravitreal Injectable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-VEGF</li><li>Steroids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intravitreal injectable market primarily consists of two key types: anti-VEGF and steroids. Anti-VEGF agents are used to treat retinal diseases by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, reducing abnormal blood vessel growth and fluid leakage. Steroids, on the other hand, provide anti-inflammatory effects and are effective in managing conditions like diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. Both types are critical in addressing vision-threatening diseases and improving patient outcomes in ophthalmology.</p></p>
