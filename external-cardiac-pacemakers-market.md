<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The external cardiac pacemaker market is primarily divided into two types: single chamber pacemakers and dual chamber pacemakers. Single chamber pacemakers stimulate one heart chamber, typically the right ventricle, providing essential pacing for patients with bradycardia. In contrast, dual chamber pacemakers coordinate electrical activity between both the atrium and ventricle, enhancing cardiac function and ensuring effective heart rhythm management. Both types play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those with heart rhythm disorders.</p></p>

<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bradycardia</li><li>Atrial Fibrillation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The external cardiac pacemakers market primarily addresses conditions such as bradycardia, where the heart beats too slowly, potentially leading to fatigue or fainting. Atrial fibrillation, characterized by irregular heartbeats, also benefits from pacing interventions to restore normal rhythm. Other applications include managing tachycardia and heart block, enhancing overall cardiac function. The demand for these devices is driven by their ability to provide temporary or permanent solutions for various arrhythmias, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>
