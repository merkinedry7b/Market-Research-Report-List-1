<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Gas Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li><li>Dry Scrubbers</li><li>Membrane Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The exhaust gas scrubber market encompasses various types designed to reduce pollutants from vessel emissions. Open-loop scrubbers utilize seawater to neutralize acid and discharge it back into the ocean. Closed-loop scrubbers, on the other hand, recycle a chemical solution for cleaner exhaust but require waste management. Hybrid scrubbers combine both systems for flexibility. Dry scrubbers use solid sorbents for pollutant capture, while membrane scrubbers leverage selective separation technology, efficiently removing contaminants while minimizing water usage.</p></p>
