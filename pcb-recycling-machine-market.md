<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Recycling Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-voltage Electrostatic Separation Type</li><li>Non-high voltage Electrostatic Separation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCB recycling machine market is categorized into two main types: high-voltage electrostatic separation and non-high-voltage electrostatic separation. High-voltage electrostatic separation utilizes intense electrical fields to efficiently separate conductive and non-conductive materials, enhancing recovery rates of valuable metals. In contrast, non-high-voltage electrostatic separation employs lower voltages, focusing on a gentler process that is less likely to damage sensitive components. Both types aim to maximize resource recovery, contribute to environmental sustainability, and reduce electronic waste in the recycling process.</p></p>
